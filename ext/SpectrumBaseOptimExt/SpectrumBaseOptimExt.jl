# Optimization extension for SpectrumBase

module SpectrumBaseOptimExt

using SpectrumBase
using StructArrays, Optim

# define the fitting problem
# make a solution struct for keeping the solution and
# define functions for showing the fitting statistics of the solution
# important ones are residues, sum square error, degrees of freedom, mse (rmsd)

# define the solve function
